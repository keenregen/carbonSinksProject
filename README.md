# Carbon Sinks Web Project

## An engaging and educative, daily-challenge-based, Superchain web 3 project, giving meaningful NFTs as prizes, promoting environmental responsibility

### Carbon Sinks is an engaging and educative, daily-challenge-based, Superchain web 3 project, giving meaningful NFTs as prizes, promoting environmental responsibility. As of 13.08.2023, four Carbon Sinks challenges (four multiple choice questions about environmental subjects) and four related NFT Collections were deployed to the testnets of four Superchain members: Base, Mode, Optimism, Zora. When a challenge is solved, a meaningful NFT can be claimed as a prize. The NFT prizes are related to each other and are precious collectibles. They present educational information in their descriptions, encouraging environmental responsibility. An account has only one opportunity to solve a challenge and can posses just one prize from that challenge. Also, an NFT bridge is currently being built using Hyperlane Warp Routes. The bridge is planned to eventually serve people who wish to transfer their prizes to other chains or consolidate their prizes within a single chain. The project's demo version is ready at https://carbon-sinks-home.vercel.app/
